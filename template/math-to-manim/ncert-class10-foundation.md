# Indian NCERT Class 10 Foundation Baseline

This document defines the foundational knowledge baseline for JEE/NEET problem-solving mode. When building solution trees, **STOP** prerequisite/concept recursion at this level - assume students have solid understanding of these concepts from Indian NCERT Class 10 curriculum.

## Purpose

In JEE/NEET problem-solving mode, the **SolutionExplorer agent** (Agent 2) must know when to STOP looking for deeper prerequisites. This baseline represents what a student preparing for competitive exams is expected to know without further derivation.

**Foundation Detection Rule**: If a concept or formula appears in this document, do NOT recursively explore its prerequisites. Treat it as foundational.

## Physics Foundations

### 1. Motion in a Straight Line

**Concepts**:
- Displacement, velocity, acceleration
- Uniform and non-uniform motion
- Distance vs displacement, speed vs velocity

**Equations of Motion** (for constant acceleration):
```latex
v = u + at
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2
v^2 = u^2 + 2as
```
Where: u = initial velocity, v = final velocity, a = acceleration, t = time, s = displacement

**Graphical Analysis**:
- Position-time graphs (slope = velocity)
- Velocity-time graphs (slope = acceleration, area = displacement)

### 2. Force and Newton's Laws

**Newton's Three Laws**:
1. **First Law**: Object at rest stays at rest, object in motion stays in motion (unless external force acts)
2. **Second Law**: F = ma (Force = mass × acceleration)
3. **Third Law**: Action and reaction forces are equal and opposite

**Concepts**:
- Inertia, momentum (p = mv)
- Friction (static and kinetic)
- Weight = mg

### 3. Work, Energy, and Power

**Definitions**:
- Work: W = F × s × cos(θ) (force component in direction of displacement)
- Energy: Capacity to do work
- Power: P = W/t (rate of doing work)

**Types of Energy**:
- Kinetic Energy: KE = ½mv²
- Potential Energy (gravitational): PE = mgh
- **Law of Conservation of Energy**: Total energy remains constant in an isolated system

**Work-Energy Theorem**: Work done = Change in kinetic energy

### 4. Electricity

**Ohm's Law**:
```latex
V = IR
```
Where: V = potential difference (voltage), I = current, R = resistance

**Resistance**:
- Depends on material, length, cross-sectional area: R = ρL/A
- **Series combination**: R_total = R₁ + R₂ + R₃ + ...
- **Parallel combination**: 1/R_total = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃ + ...

**Electrical Power**:
```latex
P = VI = I^2R = V^2/R
```

**Electrical Energy**:
```latex
E = P \times t = VIt
```

### 5. Light - Reflection and Refraction

**Laws of Reflection**:
- Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection
- Incident ray, reflected ray, and normal lie in the same plane

**Mirror Formula**:
```latex
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u}
```
Where: f = focal length, v = image distance, u = object distance

**Magnification**:
```latex
m = \frac{h'}{h} = \frac{v}{u}
```

**Snell's Law** (Refraction):
```latex
n_1 \sin\theta_1 = n_2 \sin\theta_2
```
Where: n = refractive index, θ = angle with normal

**Lens Formula** (same as mirror formula):
```latex
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u}
```

**Key Relationships**:
```latex
\text{Number of moles (n)} = \frac{\text{Mass (m)}}{\text{Molar mass (M)}} = \frac{\text{Number of particles (N)}}{N_A}
```

**Molar Mass**: Sum of atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule (in g/mol)
- Example: H₂O → M = 2(1) + 16 = 18 g/mol

### 2. Chemical Reactions and Equations

**Balancing Chemical Equations**:
- Same number of atoms of each element on both sides
- Coefficients (not subscripts) are adjusted

**Types of Reactions**:

### 3. Stoichiometry Basics

**Mole Ratio**: From balanced equation coefficients
- Example: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O
  - Mole ratio: H₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 2 : 1 : 2

## How to Use This Baseline

### For Agent 2 (SolutionExplorer)

When building a solution tree:

1. **Identify concepts/formulas used in each solution step**
2. **Check if they appear in this document**:
   - **YES** → Mark as `is_foundation: true`, do NOT explore prerequisites further
   - **NO** → This is an advanced concept, may need brief explanation in the "Explaining Phase" (30% of time)

3. **Example**:
   - Problem uses: v² = u² + 2as
   - Check this document → Found in "Equations of Motion"
   - Action: Mark as foundation, no need to derive this equation
   - In explaining phase: Just say "Using the equation of motion for constant acceleration"

### For Agent 5 (SolutionComposer)

When composing explanations:

1. **Foundation concepts**: Reference with "NCERT Class 10 [topic]"
   - Example: "Using NCERT Class 10 trigonometry, sin(30°) = 1/2"

2. **Advanced concepts**: Provide brief explanation
   - Example: "We use vector resolution here - breaking a single vector into perpendicular components makes calculations easier"

### For Agent 3 (MathematicalEnricher)

When enriching solution steps:

1. **Foundation formulas**: State directly without derivation
2. **Advanced formulas**: Include brief justification or reference to foundation
